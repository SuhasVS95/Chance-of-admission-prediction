# Chance-of-admission-prediction

# Problem Statement:

To get into an university to do a Masters degress various factors are considered. I have picked up this dataset from Kaggle which will mimic the parameters and predict the probability of getting into an university. The exercises worked out here are only using Linear Regression model.
